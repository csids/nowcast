"data_fake_nowcasting_county_aggregated"

#' Aggregation of data for nowcasting
#'
#' Aggregates mortality data to a weekly basis.
#' Where the percentiles and number of mortalities obtained after every week up to n_week is also given.
#' For more details see the help vignette:
#'
#' \code{vignette("intro", package="nowcast")}
#'
#' @param data Dataset containing doe (Date of event), dor (Date of registation) and location_code. The columns must have these exact names.
#' @param aggregation_date Date of aggregation
#' @param n_week Number of weeks to calculate the percentage of the total registraations. Must be larger og equal to 2 amd smaller than the total number of weeks in the dataset.
#' @param pop_data Population data, must contain a column called pop with the population data and a column with year and possibly week.
